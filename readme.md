## **Challenge BBVA Data & Analytics**


As you might know, we have a site (www.bbvadata.com) where, among other things, we
share ideas in a blog format. In this challenge, we provide you with two datasets: the first
one (blog_analytics.csv) is obtained from Google Analytics, and contains information such
as number of visits, page information, averaged time spent on each page, and so on. The
second one (blog_scraping.json) contains the results of the scraping of our own web, hence
consisting of fields like title, url, timestamp of publication or content.

The proposed questions are the following:
    * How would you merge both datasets? What do you observe?
    * Identify the trending topics in our blog. Besides, are we missing any important topic
    (regarding Data Science, Product creation, etc.)?
    * Which is the most successful post?
    * Build an analytical model that predicts the average time on a given article.
    *  The bounce rate (defined as https://goo.gl/fywvUr) is quite high in our website. Which
    actions (analytical or not) would you suggest to reduce it? Can you think of any
    model that would help us here?
    * Create an engine that, given an article, suggests the next one to read.
    * Suggest actions to take (as a DS) in order to:
        * maximize the number of readers
        * maximize the time spent on the site
        * maximize the number of CVs that we receive as a result of a post
    * Suggest additional data that we should collect in order to measure and improve any
    of the above business objectives.
